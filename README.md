Right clicking on a particle entry will allow you to import/export that particle's track data. Not too much is known on how to parse track data other than it deals with colors and other important stuff with the particle, so I figure the next best thing is to at least be able to export it and play around with it and import it back in. 

Please let me know if there are any issues with the program at: @Struggleton on Twitter / Struggleton#4071 on Discord / or opening an issue here on Github! Commits are welcome, especially if they fix bugs and or introduce new functionality. 

Check out the GNT4 community on Discord where much work is being done to mod the game to new leaps and bounds: https://discord.gg/DZfVuJ7
